# Computer-Graphics
The project aims to address challenges related to visualizing, approximating, and presenting an electric power grid using graphical elements in a 2D format. It provides features such as shape and text input, network display, undo/redo functionality, adding images to network nodes, and reverting all changes to restore the original state. Users can manipulate shapes like polygons and ellipses, adjusting their size, color, transparency, edge thickness, and adding text within them. Additionally, the project offers options such as slider movement to zoom in or out, showing/hiding the active network, coloring entities by connection count, coloring lines by resistance, animating colors, and setting animation duration to efficiently track energy flow, loads, voltages, and other parameters. The project also focuses on addressing performance issues in rendering the electrical network by employing a modified BFS algorithm, chosen for its speed in finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, crucial for determining connectivity between entities.
